# Space Indavers Project

## Description

This project is a re-creation of the classic arcade game space invaders, using the Python library, Turtle, and object-oriented programming concepts.
Users can use keyboard commands to control a player, with the goal of shooting enemies. Players can advance through levels with increasing difficulty. 
The high score is recorded at each game over, and held in a text file to be remembered next time.
